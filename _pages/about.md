My name is Minseon Gwak and I am a postdoctoral researcher with the Department of Electrical Engineering at [Pohang University of Science and Technology](https://www.postech.ac.kr/eng/index.do) (POSTECH). I work on `deep state space models` and `efficient long sequence modeling`, with a focus on the intersection of `control theory` and `deep learning`. 

I earned my Ph.D. in deep seqeunce modeling with linear system theory from the Department of Electrical Engineering at [POSTECH](https://www.postech.ac.kr/eng/index.do), under the supervision of [Prof. PooGyeon Park](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?hl=ko&user=ktTQiqsAAAAJ&view_op=list_works). My work has been published in leading conferences and journals, including a main conference paper at [NeurIPS 2024](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2024), and a regular paper in [IEEE TII](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=9424). I was honored with the Best Research of the Year Award in my department in both 2023 and 2024. During my Ph.D., I spent 6 months as a visiting scholar at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw47i_BhBTEiwAaJfPpv9xxP4XJhp-kzag7Oh7QGOfD6n9r61aXLVZD-XGMm5tLtzEp0IGMhoCjZAQAvD_BwE). Prior to starting my Ph.D., I received the Best Graduation Capstone Project Award in 2018.
