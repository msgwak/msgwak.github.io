My name is Minseon Gwak and I am a Ph.D. student with the Department of Electrical Engineering at [Pohang University of Science and Technology](https://www.postech.ac.kr/eng/index.do) (POSTECH), advised by [Prof. PooGyeon Park](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?hl=ko&user=ktTQiqsAAAAJ&view_op=list_works).
I work on `deep state space models` and `efficient long sequence modeling`, with a focus on the intersection of `control theory` and `deep learning`. 

During my Ph.D., I have published research papers in leading conferences and journals, including a main conference paper at [NeurIPS 2024](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2024), and a regular journal paper in [IEEE TII](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=9424), and was honored with the Best Research of the Year Award from POSTECH EE in both 2023 and 2024. I also spent 6 months as a visiting scholar at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw47i_BhBTEiwAaJfPpv9xxP4XJhp-kzag7Oh7QGOfD6n9r61aXLVZD-XGMm5tLtzEp0IGMhoCjZAQAvD_BwE), fully supported by a Korean government fellowship, where I deepened my expertise in deep learning. Prior to starting my Ph.D., I received the Best Capstone Project Award from POSTECH EE in 2018.
