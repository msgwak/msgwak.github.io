I am a 4th year Ph.D. student in Electrical Engineering at Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), advised by [Prof. PooGyeon Park](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?hl=ko&user=ktTQiqsAAAAJ&view_op=list_works).
My research focuses on advancing sequence modeling through `system theory` and `deep state space models (SSMs)`.

I am interested in applications involving the classification and prediction of `time-series data`, such as vibration, temperature, and voltage. 
Additionally, I focus on modeling tasks for very long sequences, including `(byte-level) language` and `DNA sequence`, aiming to perform these tasks in a stable and efficient manner.
SSMs provide a scalable and practical tool for such tasks, which motivates my research on `developing novel fundamental SSMs` and `generalizing Mamba`, leveraging insights from system theory.

I completed my B.S. and M.S. in Electrical Engineering at POSTECH under the supervision of [Prof. PooGyeon Park](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?hl=ko&user=ktTQiqsAAAAJ&view_op=list_works).
